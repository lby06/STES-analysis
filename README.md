# STES-analysis
## Intro
This work analyzed and visualized the Techno-Economic characteristics of Seasonal Thermal Energy Storage in Local Multi-Energy Systems.The results show that STES is more economical in high-latitude cities with significant seasonal heat demand variations and its optimal capacities based on two key factors: 1) the heat and cooling load ratio in the total energy demand, and 2) the carbon price.
